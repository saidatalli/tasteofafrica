## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I designed the website with HTML and vanilla CSS. I used display flex mainly for the layout but I also used grid for the header. I used Javascript for the hamburger menu on mobile version. 

## Optimizations

I spent so much time on things like header, pic gallery, etc. Next time, I would love to use react or other framework to speed up the development process. I would also love to add scrollable slides on the cuisine section instead of a static gallery for the foods.

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt to write more pseudo codes before I start coding and/or deisgning so that I have a clear idea of the final website.


## Examples:
Take a look at another example that I have in my own portfolio:
